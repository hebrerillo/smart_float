An example of a smart float bottom element in pure JavaScript.

Problem: On mobile devices, when focusing on an input, the mobiel keyboard appears. This could cause that some floating elements could hide some input fields, making user experience really bad.

The goal of this project is to show an example of an element that will hide in a smart way.

The element will be hidden:

- When the user focus on an input.

- When the user scrolls down the page and the focused element is an input.

The element will be be shown:

- After 5 seconds of inactivity.

- When the user scrolls up the page.

- When the end of the form is displayed.
